# Watershed

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/klgraham/watershed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/klgraham/watershed)

Watershed provides a framework for working with Probabilistic Graphical
Models (PGMs) in Clojure. It's designed with experimentation and learning in
mind, so you can quickly define your own PGM and perform queries. At
present, this is setup mainly for analyzing Bayesian Networks, which are also
Directed Acyclic Graphs.

Probability distributions currently included:

	* Uniform
	* Standard Normal
	* Boolean (true/false)
	* Bernoulli
	* Exponential
	* Discrete Uniform
    * Poisson
	* Binomial
	* Fair coin
	* Biased coin
	* Pair of N-Sided Dice

Probability distributions to be added:

	* Gaussian
	* Dirichlet

Bayesian Networks currently included:

	* Rain example

Bayesian Networks to be added:

	* Student example from Koller & Friedman's PGM textbook

Note: I've worked on this off and on since the the start of 2014; mainly as a way to facilitate learning about Bayesian Networks.
I doubt that I've implemented things in the most efficient way, but it works and the code is clear.

## Installation

### Leiningen

Add the following to your `:dependencies` in `project.clj`:

```clj
[watershed "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>watershed</groupId>
  <artifactId>watershed</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

## Usage

For now, please look at the examples in examples.clj. They should all be
straightforward. There are two PGM examples:

	1. the common "Rain" example
	2. the Student's example

There are also examples of how to use this for basic probability stuff,
though for things like that it's perhaps better to use [Incanter](http://incanter.org).
