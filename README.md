# probable-clj

This is some simple code to play with probability distributions in Clojure. I was reading a blog post [Climbing the probability distribution ladder]
[1] about a Scala library for probability distributions and wanted to follow along in Clojure.

I've implemented most of the distributions and other functionality that are found in the article. I have
not done anything with the histogram visualization as yet.

## Usage

Look at the code in examples.clj.
